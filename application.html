            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Dragon Sweeper is a fresh take on a classic game from the 90s: Minesweeper. In Minesweeper, the goal of the game was to safely mark all mines on a grid by process of elimination. In Dragon Sweeper, the goal of the game is to find enough treasure to make you strong enough to face the dragon at the center of the map. However, there is much more to worry about than mines along the way: monsters and traps that guard the treasure you need to get stronger. Through a cycle of sacrificing health points for treasure that eventually allows you to heal and get stronger than before, you slowly gain the strength you need to eventually overcome the dragon!</p>

                <li>The safest move to start is to click on the <img src="images/crystalball.png" alt="crystal ball">, which will reveal a small area of the map for you.</li>
                <li>Check how many hearts you have (5 to start), and click on a revealed enemy with a power level equal to or less than that.
